# Advent of code 2023

Let's try Smalltalk this year!  I think I read a book about Smalltalk-80 over
20 years ago, but I remember almost nothing about it, so this should be fun.

I'm starting off with [Squeak](https://squeak.org/), but might move to
[Pharo](https://pharo.org/web/) later if it seems nicer?

I am really not sure how to publish my code.  It seems like my program lives
inside a 60MB VM image of some sort.  Distributing this file feels odd, so I'm
just making a "project" for each day with a workspace where I'm solving
problems, and including a .text transcript for now.
